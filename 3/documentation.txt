function: command_line
method declaration:
void command_line(int argc, char ** argv, string & file1 , string & file2, string & file3, int & k_organisms,int & flag )

	What the function command_line does is it handles taking in the arguments from the command line.
This function was made to be very versatile such that it can take in both standard run time commands
and can use variable assignment from the command line(giving those unassigned a deafult value). It 
also acqures the number of organisms and the print format. This parser of sorts also is ready to
handle interpreting which score file to use. The variables are as d = reference q = query s = score
n = top number of organisms a = flag for print. 

function: intS
method declaration: void initS( double (& sarr)[18] ,ifstream &in)
	This function takes in the ifstream in by reference and an array of size 18 with unknown entries.
The file it takes in must be in the Format as follows those with two letters only:
				A		C		T		G		
		A		AA	AC	AT	AG
			
		C		CA	CC	CT	CT
		
		T		TA	TC	TT	TG
		
		G		GA	GC	GT	GG
			P1(first penality)	P2(consecutive penalties)
			
/end
	It places these value from left to right, top to bottome into the array of doubles sarr. Which
will later be referenced to get the scores.

function: newscore
method declaration: double newscore(char a, char b,double (&sarr)[18])
	This function takes in the two characters to calculate the score defined in the sarr an array of
size 18. Uses switch statements on the two characters to determine which score to return.
