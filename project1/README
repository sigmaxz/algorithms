Implementations:
	I used an array because I thought it would be beneficial when in large numbers an array isn't limited by the size of the string for the number of digits.

Problems:
	*I would get an L at the end of the mul int. I looked it up and it said that it stands for Long so it wasn't really an error. 

	*for the m in the final return of mul i subbed 2strsub to fix a werid bug where it would increase it by full size max
